    <h1>Florida Panther</h1>
      <p>
      <div class="square-2">
        The Florida Panther is native to Florida.  Born with spots that fade over time into adulthood, the Florida Panther inhabits the forest, specifically hardwood hammocks, cypress swamps, pinelands, and hardwood swamps.  As recent as 2008, the Florida Panther has been listed as critically endangered and inhabited only 5% of its historical territory.  However, efforts to preserve the panther's population have seen its population rise in the past decades.
