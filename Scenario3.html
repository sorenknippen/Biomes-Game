        The American Alligator is a reptile that primarily lives in the Southeastern United States.  These reptiles usually live for around 35 to 50 years.  The American Alligator inhabit rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, bayous, and marshes.Â Alligators have webbed feet and strong tails that help them navigate the water.  Reaching 10 to 15 feet tall,  Alligators are not to be messed with.
